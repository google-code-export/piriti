/**
 * <p> Controls the ordering of fields and properties in a class. </p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage </h3>
 *
 * <p> <tt> @XmlAccessorOrder </tt> annotation can be used with the following
 * program elements:</p> 
 * 
 * <ul> 
 *   <li> package</li>
 *   <li> a top level class </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> See "Package Specification" in <tt>javax.xml.bind</tt> package javadoc for
 * additional common information.</p>
 *
 * <p>The effective {@link XmlAccessOrder} on a class is determined
 * as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> If there is a <tt>@XmlAccessorOrder</tt> on a class, then
 *        it is used. </li>
 *   <li> Otherwise, if a <tt>@XmlAccessorOrder </tt> exists on one of
 *        its super classes, then it is inherited (by the virtue of
 *        {@link Inherited})
 *   <li> Otherwise, the <tt>@XmlAccessorOrder</tt> on the package
 *        of the class is used, if it's there.
 *   <li> Otherwise {@link XmlAccessOrder#UNDEFINED}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This annotation can be used with the following annotations:
 *    {@link XmlType}, {@link XmlRootElement}, {@link XmlAccessorType}, 
 *    {@link XmlSchema}, {@link XmlSchemaType}, {@link XmlSchemaTypes}, 
 *    , {@link XmlJavaTypeAdapter}. It can also be used with the
 *    following annotations at the package level: {@link XmlJavaTypeAdapter}.
