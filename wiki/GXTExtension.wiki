#summary Extension for the GXT framework.

= Introduction =

[http://www.extjs.com/products/gwt/ GXT] uses the class [http://www.extjs.com/deploy/gxtdocs/com/extjs/gxt/ui/client/data/ModelData.html ModelData] for their widgets. Using the GXT extension it is possible to map XML / JSON data right into GXT models. Simply put GXT models are kind of maps with key value pairs. Due to the lack of fields in the GXT models the mapping information is placed inside a class annotation:

{{{
@XmlModel({@XmlField(property = "isbn", type = String.class), 
    @XmlField(property = "pages", type = Integer.class),
    @XmlField(property = "title", type = String.class), 
    @XmlField(property = "author", type = Author.class),
    @XmlField(path = "reviews/review", property = "reviews", 
        type = List.class, typeVariable = String.class)})
public class Book extends BaseModel
{
    public interface BookXmlReader extends XmlModelReader<Book>
    {
    }

    public static final BookXmlReader XML = GWT.create(BookXmlReader.class);
}
}}}

= XML Mappnig = 
The XML mapping is done using
  * @XmlModel class level annotations which contains several 
  * @XmlField annotations together with
  * XmlModelReader<T extends ModelData>

= JSON Mapping = 
The JSON mapping is done using
  * @JsonModel class level annotations which contains several 
  * @JsonField annotations together with
  * JsonModelReader<T extends ModelData> 

= Differences To The Core Mapping =

= Arrays =

= Collections =
