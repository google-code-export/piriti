#summary Ordering in Piriti

= Order =
Piriti processes all annotated fields in random order. If you depend on a specific order, you can use the `order` attribute. Suppose you have the following model:
{{{
public class User
{
    @Json(order = 0) String username;
    @Json(order = 2) String firstname; 
    @Json(order = 1) String surname;
    @Json int age; 
    @Json boolean valid;
}
}}}

When reading / writing JSON data the fields are proceesed in this order
  # username
  # surname
  # firstname
  # age or valid 
  # age or valid (order is not specified)
