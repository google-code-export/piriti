#summary References in Piriti

= References =
Because all reader / writer instances are registered against a global registry, references to other types that also have a reader / writer are recognized and mapped. The only requirement is, that the reader / writer definitions must be static:
{{{
public class Book
{
    interface BookReader extends XmlReader<Book> {}
    public static final BookReader XML = GWT.create(BookReader.class);

    @Xml String name;
    @Xml Author author;
}

public class Author
{
    interface AuthorReader extends XmlReader<Author> {}
    public static final AuthorReader XML = GWT.create(AuthorReader.class);

    @Xml String firstname;
    @Xml String surname;
}
}}}

When reading a book from JSON which also contains author information, the author is mapped and assigned to Book.author.
