#summary Instructions on how to build piriti.

= Requirements =
Piriti is build using maven. Not all dependencies are available in remote repositories. To sucessfully build piriti from source you have to add some of its dependencies to your local repository (a more detailed description of the dependencies can be found in  [http://piriti.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/site/dependencies.html]):

  # Gin
  {{{
  mvn install:install-file 
      -DgroupId=com.google.gwt.inject 
      -DartifactId=gin 
      -Dversion=1.0 
      -Dpackaging=jar 
      -Dfile=<location on disk>
  }}}
  # GWTXPath
  {{{
  mvn install:install-file 
      -DgroupId=com.mouchel.gwt.xpath 
      -DartifactId=gwtxpath 
      -Dversion=1.0 
      -Dpackaging=jar 
      -Dfile=<location on disk>
  }}}  

= Build Instructions =

After installing these dependencies to your local repository, you should be able to build piriti by calling 
{{{
mvn clean install
}}}

If you working with eclipse you can generate the necessary project files by calling 
{{{
mvn eclipse:eclipse
}}} 
The generated project has the relevant GWT natures and is recognized by the Goole Eclipse plug-in.
