|| java.util.Date || fieldname/text() || If no format is specified a default format is used. Otherwise must be a valid date format as described by DateTimeFormat. ||
|| double, Double || fieldname/text() || If no format is specified the XML data is converted using Double.parseDouble(String). Otherwise must be a valid number format as described by NumberFormat. ||
|| float, Float || fieldname/text() || If no format is specified the XML data is converted using Float#parseDouble(String). Otherwise must be a valid number format as described by NumberFormat. ||
|| int, Integer || fieldname/text() || If no format is specified the XML data is converted using Integer#parseDouble(String). Otherwise must be a valid number format as described by NumberFormat. ||
|| long, Long || fieldname/text() || If no format is specified the XML data is converted using Long#parseDouble(String). Otherwise must be a valid number format as described by NumberFormat. ||
|| short, Short || fieldname/text() || No format supported. If specified it is ignored. ||

= Limitations = 

  * The mapping of arrays, collections and maps is not yet implemented.
