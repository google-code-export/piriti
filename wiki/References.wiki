#summary References in Piriti

= References =
When a reader / writer is instantiated it is registered against a global registry. Therefore references to other types that also have a reader / writer are recognized and mapped:
{{{
public class Book
{
    interface BookReader extends XmlReader<Book> {}
    public static final BookReader XML = GWT.create(BookReader.class);

    String name;
    Author author;
}
}}}
{{{
public class Author
{
    interface AuthorReader extends XmlReader<Author> {}
    public static final AuthorReader XML = GWT.create(AuthorReader.class);

    String firstname;
    String surname;
}
}}}
When reading a book from JSON / XML which also contains author information, the author is mapped and assigned to Book.author.

== Requirement ==
In order to use references following conditions must be met:
  All readers / writers of types which make up the references must be initialized *before* the first reader / writer is used. 
  
In the above example !AuthorReader has to be initialized _before_ !BookReader.read() is called. Initialized means the call of GWT.create() has to happen. As long as you declare your reader / writer instances a static members, Piriti will take care of this. Once you have your reader / writer instances _outside_ of your POJO, you have to take care of the initialization by yourself:
{{{
public class Book
{
    String name;
    Author author;
}
}}}
{{{
public class Author
{
    String firstname;
    String surname;
}
}}}
{{{
public interface BookReader extends XmlReader<Book> {}
}}}
{{{
public interface AuthorReader extends XmlReader<Author> {}
}}}
{{{
public final class Readers 
{
    public static final BookReader BOOK_READER = GWT.create(BookReader.class);
    public static final AuthorReader AUTHOR_READER = GWT.create(AuthorReader.class);
    
    // Just there to have a method to call, load the class and trigger GWT.create() calls
    public void initialize() {}
}
}}}
{{{
public class AppEntryPoint implements EntryPoint
{
    public void onModuleLoad()
    {
        Readers.initialize();
        ...
    }
}
}}}

Whenever possible I strongly recommend to use [ReaderWriter#GIN_Setup GIN] to create and initialize your reader / writer instances. Doing so you can be sure that all readers / writers are initialized and registered before you (de)serialize your first POJO. 
         
== Polymorphic References ==
Piriti supports the mapping of polymorphic references as shown in the following example (reader definitions omitted)
{{{
{
  "mediums": [
    {
      "id": "isbn-978-0345417954",
      "title": "The Hotel New Hampshire",
      "pages": 432
    },
    {
      "id": "cd-1234",
      "title": "Stadium Arcadium",
      "tracks": 28
    },
    {
      "id": "dvd-5678",
      "title": "Reservoir Dogs",
      "duration": 99
    }
  ]
}
}}}
{{{
public class Library
{
    List<Medium> mediums;
}

public abstract class Medium
{
    String id;
    String title;
}

public class Book extends Medium
{
    int pages;
}

public class Cd extends Medium
{
    int tracks;
}

public class Dvd extends Medium
{
    int duration;
}
}}} 

In order to map the medium list in Library Piriti has to know how to create concrete instances of Medium subclasses. Therefore you have to specify an [DefaultsAndAnnotations#CreateWith InstanceCreator] using the @!CreateWith annotation:
{{{
public class Library
{
    @CreateWith(MediumCreator.class)
    List<Medium> mediums;
}
}}}
{{{
public class MediumCreator extends JsonInstanceCreator<Medium>
{
    @Override
    public Medium newInstance(JSONValue context)
    {
        Medium medium = null;
        JSONObject jsonObject = context.isObject();
        if (jsonObject != null)
        {
            JSONValue idValue = jsonObject.get("id");
            if (idValue != null)
            {
                JSONString idString = idValue.isString();
                if (idString != null)
                {
                    String id = idString.stringValue();
                    if (id.startsWith("isbn-"))
                    {
                        medium = new Book();
                    }
                    else if (id.startsWith("cd-"))
                    {
                        medium = new Cd();
                    }
                    if (id.startsWith("dvd-"))
                    {
                        medium = new Dvd();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return medium;
    }
}
}}}
