/**
 * <p>
 * Maps a JavaBean property to a map of wildcard attributes.
 *
 * <p> <b>Usage</b> </p>
 * <p>
 * The <tt>&#64;XmlAnyAttribute</tt> annotation can be used with the
 * following program elements: 
 * <ul> 
 *   <li> JavaBean property </li>
 *   <li> non static, non transient field </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>See "Package Specification" in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for
 * additional common information.</p>
 * 
 * The usage is subject to the following constraints:
 * <ul> 
 *   <li> At most one field or property in a class can be annotated
 *        with <tt>&#64;XmlAnyAttribute</tt>.  </li>
 *   <li> The type of the property or the field must <tt>java.util.Map</tt> </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * While processing attributes to be unmarshalled into a value class,
 * each attribute that is not statically associated with another 
 * JavaBean property, via {@link XmlAttribute}, is entered into the 
 * wildcard attribute map represented by 
 * {@link Map}&lt;{@link QName},{@link Object}>. The attribute QName is the
 * map's key. The key's value is the String value of the attribute.
