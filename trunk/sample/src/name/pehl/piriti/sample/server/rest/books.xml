            <review>Don't panic! Here are words of praise for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy!</review>
            <review>It's science fiction and it's extremely funny...inspired lunacy that leaves hardly a science fiction
                cliche alive.</review>
            <review>Very simply, the book is one of the funniest SF spoofs ever written, with hyperbolic ideas folding
                in on themselves.</review>
            <review>As parody, it's marvelous: It contains just about every science fiction cliche you can think of. As
                humor, it's, well, hysterical.</review>
