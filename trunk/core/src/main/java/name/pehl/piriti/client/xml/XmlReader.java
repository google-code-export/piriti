/**
 * Interface for converting an XML document / element to an instance of T or a
 * list of Ts. The implementation for this interface is generated using deferred
 * binding. All fields of T which are annotated with {@link XmlField} are
 * handled by the generated XmlReader implementation. If the xpath expression
 * behind {@link XmlField} returns some data != null the relevant field is
 * assigned with the converted value, otherwise the field remains unchanged.
 * <p>
 * Please note that the annotated fields in T must not be private!
 * <p>
 * The setup of the XmlReader is inspired by the UiBinder and is typically
 * specified as an inner class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * pubilc SmartYakizakanaState
 * {
 *     interface Reader extends XmlReader&lt;SmartYakizakanaState&gt; {}
 *     public static final Reader XML = GWT.create(Reader.class);
 *     
 *     // The fields of this POJO annotated with XmlField.
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * An XML document can then be converted to an instance of SmartYakizakanaState
 * by calling
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Document document = ...;
 * SmartYakizakanaState sys = SmartYakizakanaState.XML.read(document);
 * </pre>
